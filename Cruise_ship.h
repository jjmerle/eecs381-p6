/* It travels at the speed specified in the initial command. When it arrives at 
    an island, it docks, and then it stays for a few updates. On the first one, 
    it attempts to refuel from the island. On the next update it does nothing while 
    the passengers see the local sights. On the third update, it sets course for 
    its next destination (the closest unvisited island; in case of a tie, the first 
    in alphabetical order). When it has visited the last island, it returns to the 
    first island, the one it was originally sent to. When it arrives there, it 
    docks, does not try to refuel, and announces that the cruise is over.
 
    A Cruise_ship has fuel capacity and initial amount 500 tons, maximum speed 15., 
    fuel consumption 2 tons/nm, and resistance 0
